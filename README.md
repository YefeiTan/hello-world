# hello-world
Summer is hot as hell, but i am still alive. 
As the Hell0-World guildline says, I should introduce a bit about myself. I am a post undergrad student from UW majoring Math and Econ. Future career pathes requires programming skills. What I want to achieve is to code just a little bit for everyday. I am interested in R, Matlab, Python, SQL, and VBA. I have taken courses for the first two language, and am willing to learn the rest.
